This repository contains information for helping run `L3 Data Science: A Place to Learn and Grow`.
Here we list what is needed for the organization, events, and outreach.
The project is in it's infancy, so if you're reading this and want to help out, please get in touch!

## To Dos

* [ ] Create and Post Code of Conduct 
* [ ] Create mission statement/principals
* [ ] Create Learner Personas 
* [ ] Create Materials for Presenters

## For Presenters

The goal of `L3DS` is to have a space for those looking to learn data science grow in a nuturing, encouraging space.
We plan on taking a programming language agnostic approch, so we ask that whatever language you prepare your materials in, they can be translated to other languages.
For example, if you plan to give a talk using Python to demonstrate your code, if you submit your talk ahead of time, we will try to also re-create the examples in R or Julia. 

* Language Agnostic 
* What You Can Expect of Learners
* Avoiding Sage on Stage 
* Talk designed so others can give it, essentially a donation
* Which will require lesson plans (See Below) 

## Lesson Plans

In order to ensure high quality talks, we ask that anyone speaking adhere to the following:

* [ ] Talks clearly list out at least 5 learning objectives shaped with Bloom's taxonomy
* [ ] Talks last 45 minutes, with a check for understanding done every 15 minutes
* [ ] Materials are reproducible in either Jupyter Notebook/RMarkdown
* [ ] Group participation is used throughout lesson
* [ ] Adheres to learning level 
* [ ] Slides are availble as PDF within one week of presentation
